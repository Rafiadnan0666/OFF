# 🛰️ Artifact Fetching for Dummies

> *"Steal the Artifact. Dodge the drones. Question your life choices."*

**Artifact Fetching for Dummies** is a first-person stealth-action game built with **Unity (C#)** where you play as a *highly trained* (read: “barely qualified”) agent sent to steal the galaxy’s most dangerous relic.  
What could go wrong? Oh… *literally everything*.

## 🎮 The Mission

You’ve been “volunteered” by your boss (who might also be your worst enemy) to infiltrate a top-secret facility, snatch the Artifact, and get out alive.  
Simple? Sure. Safe? Absolutely not.

**Expect:**
- Security drones with the IQ of a potato... until they see you.
- Shiny sci-fi buttons that sometimes open doors… and sometimes explode.
- An escape sequence so rigged it should be illegal.
- Your boss being “helpful” until they’re not.

## 🕹️ Features
- **Stealth Gameplay** – Hide, sneak, and pray the drones have bad aim.
- **Dynamic Levels** – Doors, traps, and hazards that keep you moving.
- **Grappling Hook Action** – Because walking is for rookies.
- **Fully Rigged Escape Finale™** – Everything on fire, alarms blaring, no pressure.
- **Bad Decisions Simulator** – Now in glorious 3D.
